## What's next? How do I make an app with this?

- Clone this project and then open it in [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- Click [here](vscode:extension/ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) to install the Dev Containers extension.
- Once installed, open this project in a [Dev Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers).
  - VSCode should prompt you to do this. If not, open the Command Palette (⌘⇧P) and run `Dev Containers: Open Folder in Container...`.
- After the Dev Container has initialized, clone the app you will be working on into the workspace.
  - If you are making a new app, fork the base [app](https://github.com/WhaleTaleDesigns/app) as a starting point and then clone that app into the dev container.
